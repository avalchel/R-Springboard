names(titanic)


### TASK1: Port of embarkation. 
## Finding and replacing empty strings.

# Find missing values in embarked col. Replace missing values (blank or empty string) with "S"
titanic$embarked <- str_replace(titanic$embarked, "^$", "S")
# Extra check for missing rows (TRUE -> non-empty row)
titanic_embarked <- complete.cases(titanic$embarked)



### TASK2: Age. 
## Calculate mean of age col to use as value for missing values. 

# Subset titanic$age data so that only complete cases are kept
clean_age <- na.omit(titanic$age)
# Calculate mean of clean_age vector. 
# ANSWER: 29.88
mean_age <- mean(clean_age) 
# Convert mean_age to character class to match titanic$age class
mean_age <- as.character(mean_age)
# Use mean_age as substitute for missing age and NA values
titanic$age[is.na(titanic$age)] <- mean_age
# Check that there is no "NA" values in titanic$age. 
sum(complete.cases(titanic$age)) #All 1310 variables TRUE!

# Calculate median of cleaned age col. ANSWER: 28
median(clean_age) 
# Plot age distribution. ANSWER: Mode is a better "guess" for missing age values given distribution spread. 
hist(as.numeric(titanic$age))



### TASK3: Lifeboat
# Interested in looking at the distribution of passengers in different lifeboats.
# Problem: lots of missing values in boat col.
# Replace empty values in boat col with "NA"
titanic$boat <- str_replace(titanic$boat, "^$", NA)



### TASK4: Cabin
# "You notice that many passengers donâ€™t have a cabin number associated with them."
# (1) Does it make sense to fill missing cabin numbers with a value?
# ANSWER: No. Filling in a set value for missing cabin numbers would not make a difference. 
# (2) What does a missing value here mean?
# ANSWER: passenger did not survive for questioning, pssg was not supposed to board ship

# "You have a hunch that the fact that the cabin number is missing might be a useful indicator of survival."
# Create a new binary col (cabin_number) where 1 indicates that there is a cabin number, and 0 otherwise.

titanic$cabin_number <- as.numeric(titanic$cabin != "")
